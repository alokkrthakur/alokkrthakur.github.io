excerpt: "Indoor spaces in India differ from those in developed countries in various aspects, such as design and operation, indoor sources, practices, guidelines, and regulations. For example, Indian indoor spaces rely heavily on natural ventilation, which might lead to higher levels of infiltration of pollutants of outdoor origin. In the case of mechanically ventilated spaces, high or 100% recirculation is common in India. Therefore, the knowledge and insights from the previous work on IAP in developed countries have limited applicability in India. Limited work done on IAP in urban-Indian built environments is restricted to limited measurements of a few pollutant concentrations, estimation of indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios, evaluation of seasonal trends, and modeling with limited data."

This paper reviews the current measurement, modeling, and mitigation status of IAP in India, along with a comparative discussion of similar work done globally. Critical knowledge gaps are identified to lay the groundwork for future research.
