Low-cost sensors (LCS) showed strong correlations for PM₁ and PM₂.₅ but weaker performance for coarser fractions, with sub-300 nm particles contributing up to 75 ± 18% of total scattering intensity (Isc). This highlights size misclassification due to LCS limitations in detecting ultrafine particles, leading to underestimation compared to reference instruments.

Research area
======
Measurement, modeling, mitigation of air pollutants in urban built environment

![Combined](/images/combined.jpg)

Development of IoT monitors and characterization of urban built environment
======
We developed and deployed low-cost monitors to study indoor air pollutant dynamics in a multizonal residential apartment. The study captured spatio-temporal PM variations, identified key sources and transport patterns, and evaluated mitigation strategies. Sub-micron particles dominated during cooking and incense use.

Predicting Spatiotemporal Concentrations in a Multizonal Residential Apartment Using Physics-Informed Deep Learning Approach
======
Most IAQ models assume well-mixed conditions, which might not be valid in larger volumes. This study demonstrates the potential of physics-informed deep learning for predicting spatiotemporal concentrations from single-point measurements.
